🚀 Course-Selling Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)

This is the backend for my Course-Selling App, built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I will be adding a React frontend soon. This version is much more polished compared to my first app! 🎉

✅ What I Learned & Added:
.gitignore & dotenv for better security and environment management
Password Hashing using bcryptjs (coming soon) 🔐
Zod Validation for request data (planned) ✅
🔧 Setup Instructions for Cloning:
1️⃣ Create a .env file in the root directory
2️⃣ Add your credentials (MongoDB URL & JWT secret)
